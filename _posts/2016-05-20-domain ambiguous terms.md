### sequence

Biology : part of a DNA or RNA molecule; more offen refers to the abstraction thereof, as represented with letters
Programming : (usually) one of a number of data structures that arrange their elemnts linearly
Python : a linear ,and therefore number numberically indexable, collection of values.

### base

Biology : a single nucleotide in a DNA or RNA molecule
Programming : Base 10,16,2,etc.
Python : Base 10,16,2,etc., as used in input and output operations

### string

Biology : a series of letters representing a DNA,RNA, or amino acid sequence
Programming : a sequence of characters, often a  'primitive type' of a language.
Python : an immutable sequence type named str

### expression

Biology : the production of proteins under the control of cellular machinery influenced by life stage, the organ containing the cell, internal states (disease,hunger),and external conditions(dryness,heat)
Programming : (1)(generally) a combination of primitive values, operators, and function calls,with specifics differing significantly among language
              (2) regular expression: a pattern describing aset of strings with notations for types of characters, grouping, repetition, and so on ,the details of which differ among languages and editors
Python : (1)a combination of primitive values, operators and function call.
          (2a)a regular expression string
		  (2b) a regular expression string compiled into a regular expression object

### type

Biology :  the specimen of an organism first used to describe and name it
Programming : a theoretical construct defined differently in different contexts and implemented differently by different programming languages; corresponds roughly to "the kind of thing" something is and 'the kind of operations' it supports
Python : synonymous with 'class', but often used in the context of pyhton's built-in types , as posed to classees defined in a python or externally obtained library or in user code.


### translate

Biology :  convert DNA codons (base triples) to amino acids according to the geneti code of the organism
Programming : convert computer code in one language into computer code in another, typically lower-level, language
Python : a method of str that uses a table to produce a new str with all the characters of the original replaced by the corresping entries in the table.

### class

Biology :  one of the levels in the standard taxonomic classification of organisms.
Programming : in languages that support object-oriented programming, the encapsulated definition of data and related code 
Python : as in programming;more  specifically, the type of an object, which itself is an obeject that defines the methods for its instances

### loop

Biology :  a property of RNA secondary structures (among other meanings)
Programming : an action performed repeatedly until some condition is no longer true.
Python : an action performed repeatedly until  some condition is no longer true

### library

Biology :  a collection of related sequences, most commonly used in the context of a library of expressed RNA in cDNA form
Programming : like a program, but meant to be used by other programs rather than as a free-stranding application; most languages use a core set of librarys and provide a large selection of optional ones.
Python : a collection of modules, each containing a collection of related  definitions ,as in 'python comes with an extensive library of optional tools and facilities' 

### complement

Biology :  the nucleotide with which another always pairs
Programming : "two's complement " is the standard representation of negative integers
Python :

### R.E

Biology :  restriction enzyme
Programming :
Python : regular expression
